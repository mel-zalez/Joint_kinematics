Following DeepLabCut joint tracking, fill out video information in Excel file and use generate_new_skeleton.m to triangulate the position of the knee given the coordinates of the hip and ankle, the lengths of the tibia and femur in millimeteres, and the DeepLabCut tracking of the pixels to millimeters conversion grid. Use find_swing_stance_time.m to phase flag the stance and swing indeces of each step cycle. Use plot_angle_vs_step_cycle_DTR.m to calculate joint angles for individual videos and compare_angles_DTR_all_steps to calculate joint angles and compare between all the experimental and control mice.
